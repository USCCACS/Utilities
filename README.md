# Utilitie Tools for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Data Analysis

This repository is a collection of utility tools to analyze molecular dynamics simulation dataset. 

## Getting Started

The repository currently contains only one python notebook file, thus if anybody is interested in using it, simply download the ipynb file to your machine. A sample input data file (density.dat) is also available. We will be adding more tools in the future. 

### Prerequisites

You will need IPython Notebook to open the ipynb file. If you don't have python notebook setup, higly recommend to download python package from Continuum website. 
https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview

Make sure you have following files after cloning the repository, 

```
Utilities $ ls
3DDataVisualizer.ipynb  LICENSE                 README.md               density.dat
```
IPython Notebook runs on a web brower. Any commonly used web browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc) should do the job. 

## Run iPython Notebook

If you are using Mac and Linux, open terminal and type, 

```
Utilities $ ipython notebook 3DDataVisualizer.ipynb
```

This command will launch default web browser and open the ipynb file. If you are not familier with IPython notebook, please refer to online document to start.
